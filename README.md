# Community-Detection-Algorithms-Analysis

Community   Detection   is   starting to   become   an inevitable   task   for   data   science   community   and   like- minded 
analysts  to  understand  the  hidden  insights  and  trends  in  large complex   networks.   Through   the research paper   we   would   like   to understand  and  comparatively  analyze  the  prevalent  and  recent community  detection  techniques  like  Minimum  Cut  Method, Hierarchical Clustering, Girvan Newman Algorithm, Modularity Maximization,    Statistical    Inference,    Clique Percolation & Maximum    Permanence    Method    based    on    their    network relevance,  adaptability  and  robustness  to  changes  and  finally their  capacity  of  size  and  speed.  Finally, we will  review  the  real world application of these algorithms
